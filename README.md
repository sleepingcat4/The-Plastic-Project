# The Plastic Project
Equipping people with plastic-fighting resources to reduce pollution and spread plastic-awareness worldwide.
## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tylerz157/The-Plastic-Project`
2. Install the dependecies. Note that depending on how you installed Python, you may need to replace `python.exe` with `python3.exe`, `py.exe`, or possibly just `python3` (if using Linux): `python.exe -m pip install pillow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow tensorflow-text imblearn tqdm`
3. Finally, you can run the code: `python3.exe ./wasteSortingAI.py`
